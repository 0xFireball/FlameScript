# FlameScript + HappyPenguinVM

FlameScript is a highly experimental programming language.
The lexer and parser are written completely in C#.
There is also an experimental interpreter written in C# that can execute FlameScript
source code; this will provide interopability between a host application and FlameScript.
As of right now, the language itself does not support invoking methods on dynamic objects (tables) [See the language specifications]
but when that feature is implemented, you will be able to share object instances between .NET and FlameScript.
Eventually, you will be to compile to a variety of targets (for example, .NET IL bytecode, JavaScript, or NekoVM).

HappyPenguinVM is an **even more highly experimental** bytecode VM. It runs its own assembly-like list of instructions, but has
quite a few special quirks. See the [HappyPenguin Readme](HPReadme.md) for more information.
